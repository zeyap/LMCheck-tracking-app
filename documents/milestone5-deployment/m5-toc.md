## Evaluation

**Gym Tracking** 
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

*user tesing A*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

- The user was able to find a way into create tracker page, because there's a button on the corner (and no other choices), but the blank looking homepage made her hesitate for a while. 

- The two steps (add unit & add record) in numeric page have very similar UI and the user tended to input unit again. Also, it does not always make sense to have a unit when doing numeric tracking.

*user tesing B*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>
- The user did not have any issues with initiating a creation of a new tracker; he navigated to add button and selected the correct tracking format seamlessly. 

- The use experienced some issues with naming the new tracker. He selected the appropriate tracker format for the task given, but was confused when prompted to name the tracker. After naming the tracker, he expects the app to move on to the next step. The app requires to select (again) the correct tracking format after naming the app. The user was confused by this. 

- Found the process of naming unit of measurement to be straightforward, but was confused about adding an actual value. Expects to be taken back to the homepage after entering a value. 

- Was able to navigate to visualizations without any trouble.

- The main issue that the user had was understanding Numeric Measurement. When he was asked to track number of pushups, he did not have a problem finding a path to create a tracker. But, he froze as he saw three options. He told me that he did not understand the meaning of Numeric Measurement, and did not have any option but to click numeric measurement as Timer and to-do-list are clearly not for counting pushups.
- He also noted that unit page was strange at first, but understood it later as he discovered numeric measurement could track anything.

**Sleeping Tracking** 
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

*user tesing A*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

- The user initially was a little bit confused about the home page. The he noticed that there is a button on the right bottom corner.
Almost everyone would click on the timer first then realized that they need to enter a title first then creating a corresponding tracker.
Because nothing shows after click on the “finish” button. User was confused where did the data go to. Only under the hint, he clicked on the menu button and entered the view and graph list accordingly.
The animation on the graph list was fun to watch.

*user tesing B*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

- The user suggests adding the function of deleting individual timer record, which we'll consider in the future. 

- User performed smoothly with the task without much confusion, thinking our app's pretty easy to work on. He also feels the color scheme looks relaxing.

**To-do List Tracking** 
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

*user tesing A*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

- User felt very confident to create grocery list but she created tracker name after the app remind her.
- User can easily figure out to hold and delete tracker at home page but she felt confused when she want to delete an item from the list. She tried to use "delete" button on keyboard to delete.
- User thought overall the app was easy to use.

*user tesing B*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

- User was able to understand the task of recording list of groceries.
- He missed the title creation before creating a tracker, so he had to see the error sign(which he described as "unclear")
- Without being told, he clicked a circle next to each grocery to cross out.
- Deleting a tracker after shopping was unclear to him. He went into the tracker itself to delete assuming deleting function would be there. After spending a few minutes to find delete button, he was able to find it on the home pag; however, he said it would be better if there were a deleting button inside each tracker.
- He was confused on a few minor functions, but he informed us that to-do-list function does what its job and it would get easier as users use the app.
