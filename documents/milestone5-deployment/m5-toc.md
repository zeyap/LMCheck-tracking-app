## Evaluation

**We did 6 user testing (2 people per scenario) to evaluate our app. And information below are feedback we've gotten from our user-testing.**

**Gym Tracking**
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

*User Test A*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>


*User Test B*

**Sleeping Tracking**

*User Test A*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

- The user initially was a little bit confused about the home page. The he noticed that there is a button on the right bottom corner.
Almost everyone would click on the timer first then realized that they need to enter a title first then creating a corresponding tracker.
Because nothing shows after click on the “finish” button. User was confused where did the data go to. Only under the hint, he clicked on the menu button and entered the view and graph list accordingly.
The animation on the graph list was fun to watch.

*User Test B*

**To-do List Tracking**

*User Test A*
<div class=‘page-break’></div>

- User feels very confidence on creating grocery list using this app. To create a to-do list type of tracker, she first click on "to-do list" button and realized she forgot to create tracker name. This is the step that took her a little bit of time to fix what she missed. 
- It didn't take time for user to figure out how to add new item in the list.
- User assumed she could use "delete" button on keyboard to delete a item from the list but in original design designer assume user can swipe to delete item from the list.
