# Milestone2: Gathering Information & Planning


## Target Audience

Before collecting any data for our research phase. We had 3 diffent target audience to find out about needs for different groups of people.

1. Passive Tracking Application Users
    -Users who use sleep tracking application to track their sleeping patterns, but not actively feed in their data.
2. Active Tracking Application Users
    -Users who use workout application to track their fitness and workout routines, and also input their data actively.
3. Non-tracking Users
    -Users who use notebooks to write grocery lists for shopping



## Gathering Information (Interview + Affinity Diagrams)

**We decided to interview 4 individuals per target audience.**

We collected data from 12 individuals through interviews. 

Interview Questions and Analysis is [here](milestone2-documents/interview.pdf). All interview notes are stored in meeting pics folder as well.

After collecting the data, we made affinity diagrams to look for related response across interviewers for each question. Pictures of digrams are stored in meeting pics folder.


## Value Propositions

Our application offers a one stop shop for all your tracking needs. By modularizing core functionalities, users are able to customize data and gain insights. This in turn enables users to record in granularity and organize routines in life while feeling a sense of accomplishment.
