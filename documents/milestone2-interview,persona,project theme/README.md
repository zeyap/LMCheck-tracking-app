# Milestone2: Gathering Information & Planning


## Target Audience

Before collecting any data for our research phase. We had 3 diffent target audience to find out about needs for different groups of people.

1. Passive Sleep Tracking Application Users
    -Users who use sleep tracking application to track their sleeping patterns, but not actively feed in their data.
2. Active Fitness Tracking Application Users
    -Users who use workout application to track their fitness and workout routines, and also input their data actively.
3. Non-tracking Traditional Users
    -Users who use notebooks to write grocery lists for shopping



## Gathering Information (Contextual Interviews + Affinity Diagramming + Affinity Grouping)

**We decided to interview 4 individuals per target audience.**

We collected data from 12 individuals through interviews. 

Interview Questions and Analysis is [here](milestone2-documents/interview.pdf). All interview notes are stored in meeting pics folder as well.

After collecting the data, we conducted an Affinity Grouping exercise to further consolidate answers to questions per target audience and get a feeling for the sense of direction they were heading. Following which we summarized each group into a cohesive voice, and proceeded onto conducting an Affinity Diagram to further consolidate the three target audiences into one general broad audience. Afterwards, we framed these voices into task-based scenario's (People Problems In Facebook's Terminology). Based on these task-based stories, we were able to create a minimal viable product list for our feature, and prioritized them based on importance. Pictures of diagrams are stored in meeting pictures folder.


## Value Propositions

Our application offers a one stop shop for all your tracking needs. By modularizing core functionalities, users are able to customize data and gain insights. This in turn enables users to record in granularity and organize routines in life while feeling a sense of accomplishment. 
Use this app to keep track of your: progress at the gym, to-do lists, sleeping routines and more. Let this app organize your tasks for you so that you can focus on staying motivated while reaching your goals. 
The costs and barriers to adopting our application are low. It requires an app download and allows you to create customized trackers from the home page. Each tracker is easily created and updated. This app is a great alternative for those who keep traditional to-do lists using paper and pencil, or for those who struggle to take accurate logs while at the gym because they forget to specific start / end times while attempting to calculate durations.
