# Target Audiences

**Tracking app’s target audience division, based on means of input and data representation**

1. People who track passively with apps that automatically collect data
  - Health / Biometric things that are measurable with mobile devices’ builtin ability or accessories, such as heart rate, drunkenness, how much a person walk, etc.
  - Data that are analyzed from users’ semantic input, computing is done ubiquitously: applications like Spotify analyzes a user’s history of music streaming and track his/her favorite music categories, which is generated by a larger audience’ input, etc.

2. people who track actively with apps that require frequent and manual input
  - Numeric everyday record of health/biometric things like sleep patterns, exercising, calorie intake; Or regular record of natural/scientific observation, which can be very nerdy and is where google science journal falls into. Visualization is easy.
  - Daily routine represented semantically, like calendar, tracking events, inputting new events, times, coursework, task list etc. Meaningful numeric data can be derived by some math.

3. people who track via traditional / non tech methods

All of the above except users do not track with mobile devices
