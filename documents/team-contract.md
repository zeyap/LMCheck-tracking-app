# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

###1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.
    
    Team Name: Jack and Coke
    
    Team Members:

    Zidong Zhang / zz643
    Cynthia yue /  cy432 
    Sangmin Kim / sk858
    Zhiyu Mao /  zm255
    Zeya Peng / zp82

###2. To what goals do we all commit?
    To meet all the requirements of the team project

###3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
    - Respond to the messages in one hour.
    - Finish the task on time. Do not avoid conflicts.	
    - Ask for help when needed. 

###4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
    - Weekly meeting: Each Tuesday afternoon

###5. How will we communicate and work?
    - Slack

###6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

    - UX Research Team Leaders: Cynthia
    - Coding Team Leaders: Zeya
    - User Interface Design: Zhiyu
    - Hardware Prototype Design: Zidong
    - Product Management: Sangmin

###7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
    By checking the work progress in our weekly meeting. Be open and honest.

    We will be supportive to each other’s challenges, and readjust our expectations towards the final deliverables, with the baseline being the project requirements. But if the team member fail to deliver what was promised due to slackness or not being open for communication, he will be accredited less in the project.

###8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - We will handle violations of any parts of this team contract by confronting the person and addressing the situation internally. We all expect to handle this project professionally.  
    - Every team member should always respect each other as the baseline of coordination. When conflict happens, we would all discuss as a team and find what’s best for our goal. 
    - If violations continue and we have already addressed the problem as a team, we will contact a higher figure of authority (TA, or professor) on how to proceed forward. 

###9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
   Majority vote

###10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    Make a schedule ahead of time, and assign the assignments equally.

    We will be working together on compiling a complete list of assets / artifacts to include into everyone’s portfolios.
